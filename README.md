### Hi, I'm Alex 👋

I am a fourth year Electrical Engineering student at UBC keen on growing my skillset to provide a helping hand to projects that benefit our day to day lives 🌎.
I am passionate about creating a more sustainable world and am fascinated by the endless amount of problems you can solve using software. 

### 🧑‍💻 Currently...
Ideating a new project to experiment with TensorFlow 
Back in school after returning from an 8-month Co-op [@Kardium Inc.](https://kardium.com)<br />
Looking for Summer 2023 internships ☀️<br />

### 🔮 What's next...
I plan on learning the foundations of machine learning and apply my knowledge to a related role in the near future. To help me along my journey, I intend to pursue a Minor in Data Science at UBC<br />

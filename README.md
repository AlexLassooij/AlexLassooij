### Hi, I'm Alex 👋

I am in my final year at UBC studying Electrical Engineering with a Minor in Data Science. I am passionate about applications of technology in the fields of healthcare and sustainability, and have made it a point to continuously teach myself new skills and learn about the latest developments in technology. 📈

### 🧑‍💻 Currently...
Interning as a Fullstack Developer at [Selkirk Innovates](https://selkirk.ca/about-selkirk/selkirk-innovates)<br/> 
Participating in UBC's New Venture Design ([NVD](https://nvd.ubc.ca/)) program<br/>
Looking for a 2025 New Grad (or 2025 Summer Internship) placement as a SW, ML or Data Engineer ☀️<br />

### 🔮 What's next...
I plan on expanding my skillset by picking up best-practices and important tools ML Engineers need to deploy ML models and make them useful.<br/>
Additionally, I intend to refurbish some old personal projects by improving their architecture, adding documentation and allowing others to interact with them.<br/>
